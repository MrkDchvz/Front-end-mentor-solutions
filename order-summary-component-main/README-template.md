## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I learned how to make a custom box shadow of my own. Before I'm using those other people made. 
### Continued development
I'm planning to improve creating a simple, clean and human readable code. That's why I need to learn how to avoid overcomplicating things
### Useful resources

- [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This helped me to learn CSS/HTML/JS Properties in depth. 
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me solve niche problems that other people already encounter.

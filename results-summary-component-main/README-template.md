## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned the vertical align property in CSS. I have no idea that property exists. All I do is to use margins to align text and pictures. Vertical align really provided me with ease on arranging logos and text. 


### Continued development
This challenge is meant to be a refresher for me. But I also noticed that I don't really know how to write organized CSS that's why I'll focus on the readability of my code. 

### Useful resources

- [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me to remember css properties that I've forgotten and learn about new properties.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned
In this challenge I've learn how to make a decision when to use grid or flexbox. If the layout is two dimensional use grid. This will declutter the html from divs that are required in flexbox.
In one dimensional layout it depends on the situation mostly flexbox will suffice but there are niche situations where grid is needed. 

### Continued development
My knowledge about acceessability, semantic html, grid, and flexbox are shallow. I need to learn more about those concept in depth. 

### Useful resources

- [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for learning about different properties of grid. 
- [CSS Trciks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#aa-basics-browser-support) - This is helped me to get an introductory idea about grid.
